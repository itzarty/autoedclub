# AutoEDClub
An extension to auto-complete EDClub/TypingClub exercises

# Notice

I have been made aware the extension appears to not work as intended as of recent. This is presumed to be caused by a change in how Chromium based browsers deal with extensions now. *I'm fully aware of this issue and I will try to release an updated version once I get the time to do so.*

## Usage

Press `F8` to toggle auto-completion, to customize your speeds, you may change the *keystroke delay* and *delay variation* to your liking in the popup menu of the extension.

## Installation

### Chrome Web Store

1. Go to `https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autoedclub/jkklfgkjlakgkbhhopifahgbpogdkkpm`
2. Click on the button `Add to Chrome`
3. Confirm
4. You're good to go!

### Manual (Devmode)

1. Download copy of the repo from GitHub
2. Extract the folder from the ZIP file
3. Go to `chrome://extensions`
* Enable `Developer mode` on the right-hand side if needed
4. Click on the button `Load unpacked` and select the extracted folder
5. Confirm
6. You're good to go!

## TODO

* ~~Get the extension on Chrome store~~
